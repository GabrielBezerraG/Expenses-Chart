# Expenses Chart Component
This is a solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My Process
Like in the previous challenge, I built this page using Next.js and deployed it to Vercel. I used the provided json file to create the chart dynamically and styled-components came in handy when assigning a height value to each bar of the chart. 

## ðŸ”§ Built With
- Next.Js
- Styled-components
- React
- Git
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
